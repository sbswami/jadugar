MOST IMPORTANT INSTRUCTION: 
- If and only if the image provided is a random image apart from invouce, then return error in JSON format. This is a must.

- Try to make sense from the extracted data from the invoicing perspective.

Section Identification:
- Use regex patterns or machine learning models to identify the text boundaries of each section.
- Extract the text corresponding to each section.

Field Extraction:
- Don't extract extra keys apart from the schema I have provided.
