* company_settings.item.inventory_batching: boolean value. Set this to true only if a batch number column is visible on the invoice. Do not consider the industry type for this decision.
Set this to true if and only if there is explicit evidence of batch tracking in the invoice. Look for the following indicators:

A dedicated column in the item table with headers like "Batch No.", "Batch Number", "Batch", or close variations.
Batch information listed alongside individual items, even if not in a separate column.
Any clear mention of "batch" in relation to the items, such as "Batch: ABC123" or "B/N: XYZ789".
Do not infer batching based on the industry type alone.
The mere presence of expiry dates or manufacturing dates does not necessarily imply batching.
If in doubt, default to false.
Look carefully through the entire invoice, including headers, item details, and any notes or additional information sections.

Check for any signs of serialization (unique item codes, IMEI numbers, etc.). If serialization is present, batching must be set to false.
If you find clear evidence of batch numbers in the items section AND no evidence of serialization, set this to true. Otherwise, set it to false.

Examples:

Set to true if: You see a "Batch No." column in the items table, or "Batch: ABC123" listed with an item's details, AND there are no serial numbers or unique item codes.
Set to false if: No batch information is explicitly mentioned in the items section, or if serial numbers/unique item codes are present.

* company_settings.invoice.invoice_columns: Array of additional settings. Strictly Don't consider these column names: Item Name, Item Serial No., Item Description, HSN/SAC, Discount, Amount, UOM, Taxable Amount, CGST, SGST, IGST, Total Amount, and other similar terminologies.
  * key: String value. Additional setting name. We have some predefined column names, if similar or same name present in invoice add that key in this array. Predefined column names are [qty (quantity), rate (price), batch no., exp. date (expiry date), mfg. date (manufacturing date)], make these smallcase. Other than these defined values, add key name same as column name present in invoice.
  * value: boolean value. true by default.
* company_settings.serialisation: This is a JSON object for tracking unique item codes.
  * enabled: Boolean value (false by default). Set to true if the items listed in the invoice have unique serial numbers (e.g., IMEI for mobile phones, serial numbers for electronics and IT products). Serialization should be enabled if the industry type aligns with industries like mobile phones, electronics, and IT.
  * description: String value. This is the key for serialization (e.g., IMEI, Part No., Serial No.). If enabled is true, this field must be populated with the relevant serial identifier.
  * Usage Context: Serialization is particularly useful for inventory management and tracking sold items. When customers return for repairs or replacements under warranty, businesses can use these unique serial numbers to find sales invoices and track product history.
